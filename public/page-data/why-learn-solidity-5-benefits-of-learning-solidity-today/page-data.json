You will come ahead of the completion as there isn&#8217;t so much at the moment.</p>\n<p>This is why today I wanted to share with you <em>why you should learn Solidity:</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Learning Solidity will increase your chances of getting hired as a freelancer or scoring a full time job. According to <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sponsor-story/moonlighting/2018/06/04/20-in-demand-freelance-skills-that-will-get-you-hired-today/35677363/\"><strong>USAToday it is the #1 in-demand</strong></a> skill to have as a developer.</li>\n<li>Scoring a job in the field will get you the average of over <strong>$120,000 per year</strong>.

The first generation of kitties they sold they got %100 of the profits and <strong>%3.5 for every transaction</strong> after that in the dApp. Not bad, huh?</li>\n<li>Cryptocurrencies, web3 and smart contracts are the future! Even Opera, the third most used browser worldwide, has integrated crypto in their software.
